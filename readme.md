# HTTP to HTTPS Proxy Testing

npm install


The equivalent of `node server-http-7172.js` is running at https://proxytester.73rdst.com/any-old-url
This server is running behind a reverse proxy with a cert generated by letsencrypt.
The way it works is that the server is running on port 7172 and the reverse proxy is listening on port 443 and forwarding to the server on port 7172.

The proxy server, which is the one we want to proxy requests to, is
running from port 5200 to port 7172. It is using the cert that we generated
locally. If you do either a `curl -k https://localhost:5200` or a `curl -k https://localhost:7172` you will see the same output.




http://localhost:3000/ -> https://mysite.com
